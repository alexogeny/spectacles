## bio

I am a highly skilled software engineer with many talents. My core passion lies in complex problem solving and delivering elegant yet practical and pragmatic solutions.

I'm a lifelong learner and feel like a day not spent learning is a day wasted. When I'm not problem solving or learning you'll find me helping out my coworkers and contributing to the team wherever possible.

Outside of work you'll find me playing tennis, reading a book, or obsessing over the latest limited release craft beer(s).

## soft skills

- I have a strong work ethic
- I am a critical thinker &amp; problem solver
- I communicate frequently and listen actively
- I show empathy and value an inclusive team culture
- I value diversity and different perspectives
